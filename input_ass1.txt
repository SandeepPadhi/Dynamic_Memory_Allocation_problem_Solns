The idea is to try different functions one by one as per the input:


Following is the input pattern :
1)First line gives the number of operations to execeute
2)Next lines will deal with operations.Each operation has different lines.
3)Following is the code for different operation and their lines:
    1-my_calloc:
        first line-1
        second line : number_of_elements datatype_size
        thrid line: numbers to be added
    2-my-free
        first line - 2
    3-my-malloc
        first line-3
        second line : number_of_elements datatype_size
        thrid line: numbers to be added
    4-my-relloc:
        first line - 4
        second line - number of extra number_of_elements to be added to heap for reallocation of memory to expand it.
        third line - numbers to be added
